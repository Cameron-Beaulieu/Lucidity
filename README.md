# Lucidity

## What is Lucidity?
Worldbuilding is an important process for many creators and their audiences. From fantasy roleplaying games such as Dungeons and Dragons, to fictional novels, worldbuilding is a crucial step in creating an immersive experience for your audience. Current worldbuilding tools and mapmaker software do not offer enough functionality to accurately depict things such as scale, depth, or terrain, limiting one’s ability to translate their thoughts into something tangible.

Lucidity removes these challenges and resolves shortcomings by allowing users to create maps in our top-down 2D editor and then convert them to navigable 3D worlds at just the click of a button. Lucidity makes the most of your mapmaking experience and keeps others engaged in the story you want to tell. Whether you want to imagine a luscious forest surrounding a path to a dragon’s lair, or a small town of villagers up in the mountains, Lucidity can help your fantasy become reality.
